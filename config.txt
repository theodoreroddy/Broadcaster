# Broadcaster routinely cleans up old files. This affects the size of the cache
# it will maintain as a result. Lower can cause instability.

# List the formats you want to pass into ffmpeg. It is recommended to only add
# formats you know will work! Otherwise you may get errors on .NFO files for example
SUPPORTED_FORMATS=mov,mp4,mkv,avi,ts,m2ts,webm,divx,mpg

# Specify where to store the files ffmpeg generates. Storing in /tmp will keep
# them in RAM which is recommended vs. writing to a hard disk which can be slow
# or to an SSD which will just degrade the lifespan of the SSD.
